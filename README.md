## Overview

This is a combined solution to the [Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1) and a modified challenge of the [Testimonials grid section](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7), joined by a ternary login page. While no information is passed from the login, the login must be completed successfully with information in the name, email, and password sections, and the email must be valid. The Testimonials grid section is an example of pulling data from an API and looping over it to populate multiple, varying message boxes from a single component. The graphics and colors have been updated to personal aesthetic choices, but the layouts are designed to spec otherwise.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*
- Be directed to view the Testimonials Grid Setion portion of the project upon successful submission of a completed form.
